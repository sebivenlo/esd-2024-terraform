# Terraform: 
- Initialize terraform for this project with:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
- Now you can start using terraform!
- If you make changes to your configuration, you can review and generate an execution plan:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
- To apply the changes permanently, run:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
- If you need to destroy the applied infrastructure, use:
    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```
